# Stop Harassment

Stop Harassment is a project by Uplift: Online Communities Against Sexual Violence attempting to solve the problem of harassment
that many people experience once they reach a certain point of popularity online.  This disproportionately affects more women, people of color, and LGBTQIA+ individuals and these harassers work to silence these populations.

Though online platforms offer the ability to block specific harassing users, blocking one user only results in 5 more coming on to join
their place.

The problem is the harassing content, not the users, so the solution needs to lie in the content itself.

## Current Status
* Basic UI for the Chrome Extension
* Simple swap out of offensive words for nicer words or funny words
* Works for Twitter mentions page

## Future Directions
* Integration with a sophisticated backend for detecting harassing content
* Extensive settings for users (see UX in presentation) allowing the user to add additional words, whitelist users, and show hidden tweets
* Firefox and Safari extensions
* Hide harassing images
* Solution for Mobile 

## Project History
This project began at the Lesbians Who Tech Social Good Hackathon on 9/24/16.
